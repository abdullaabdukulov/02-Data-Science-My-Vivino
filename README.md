# 02-Data-Science-My-Vivino
## Task

The task involved performing analysis and implementing machine learning on the Vivino Wine Dataset. The dataset contains information about various wines, including features like Ratings, Prices, ML (milliliters), ABV % (alcohol by volume), color, and country of origin.

## Description

The project began with data cleaning, including filling missing values and converting non-numeric data to numeric values. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using visualizations such as histograms, correlation matrices, and scatter plots. Machine Learning was then applied to predict certain attributes using Random Forest Regression.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nasretdinov-n/vivino-wine-dataset.git
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the notebook `my_vivino.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset:

    Place your `vivino_dataset.csv` file in the project directory.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    Run the provided notebook to perform data analysis and explore machine learning models.

3. Modify and Experiment:

    Feel free to modify the notebook, experiment with different machine learning algorithms, or enhance visualizations according to your preferences.
