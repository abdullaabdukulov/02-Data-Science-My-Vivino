### Description
<p>My Vivino is an online marketplace. We have a vast wine database, and we have 27 million users, mainly in North America.</p>
<p>One of our leading services is a wine recommendation system. It starts to be a little old. Rules-based. We are selling wine based on our customer visit/research.</p>
<p>You've just finished a meeting with your product manager. Data science is the future, and our competitor <code>my_wine.com</code> has invested a lot in it.</p>
