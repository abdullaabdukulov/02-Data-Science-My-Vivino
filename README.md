Welcome to my vivino

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
we have main difficulty was finding data!
we have changed my data 3 times because my model didn't predict well!

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
surely we have search data from kaggle and google! 
we solved this problem by finding highly correlated data!

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
Of course we have installed Data science tools numpy, pandas, matplotlib,
seaborn and sklearn for maschine learning!

## Usage
How does it work?
This is very simple! In this project we created a price prediction model for vine data! 
First we cleaned and encoded the data.
Then we print sumriz and data correlation.
Next, we drew some visualizations to better understand the data.
Finally I have split the data int x_train, x_test, y_train and y_tes and fited sevral
sklearn models. These are GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression
DecisionTreeRegressor and KNeighborsRegressor
