## Task
My Vivino data science project aims to leverage data to enhance wine enthusiasts'

experiences by providing valuable insights, recommendations, and predictions related to wines. The primary challenge is to extract

meaningful information from the vast amount of wine-related data and present it in a user-friendly and informative manner.

## Description
To overcome data collection challenges, automated web scraping tools can be employed to gather wine-related data from various sources.

Cleaning processes, like handling missing values and inconsistencies, can be tackled using data wrangling techniques and robust data pipelines.
